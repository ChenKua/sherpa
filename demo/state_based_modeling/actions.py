        A class is the description for a set of similar objects that have the same structure and behavior, i.e., its instances
        All objects with the same features and behavior are instances of one class.
        In general, something should be a class if it could have instances.

        3. Not too general, not too specific â€“ at the right level of abstraction
        4. Avoid software engineering terms (data, record, table, information)

        there might be multiple compositions
        In a typical domain model, there is usually a "system class" that contain most of the classes within the system
        For example:
        1 SchoolSystem contain 0..* UserRole
        1 SchoolSystem contain 0..* User
        1 SchoolSystem contain 0..* Course
        1 SchoolSystem contain 0..* Registration

        example format: Class1 inherit Class2
        Class1 and Class2 are classes above. there might be multiple inheritance
        Consider the inheritance relationship within the Player-Role pattern
        For example:
        Student inherit PersonRole
        Professor inherit PersonRole
